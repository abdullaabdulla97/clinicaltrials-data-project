# Clinical Trials Data Insights (ClinicalTrials.gov)
This project is a small data pipeline that pulls clinical trial records from the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) REST API for a given medical condition, cleans and summarizes the data with Python, and then visualizes key trends in an Excel dashboard. The example in this repository use **immunology** as the default condition.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python (`pandas`, `requests`, `sqlite3`)
- ClinicalTrials.gov REST API
- SQLite (via Python)
- Excel (PivotTables and charts)

    scripts/
        fetch_trials.py  # Download and flatten raw trial data from the API
        clean_analyze.py # Clean data and generate KPI CSV files
        load_sql.py # Load cleaned data into a SQLite database
        run_sql.py # Runs SQL queries and print results

## How to Run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install pandas requests

# 2. Fetch raw trial data
# In scripts/fetch_trials.py, set the condition:
CONDITION = "immunology" # or change to a condition of interest
# Then run:
python scripts/fetch_trials.py  # This creates raw CSV files in data/raw/

# 3. Clean data and generate KPIs
# Make sure the same CONDITION value is set in clean_analyze.py, then run:
python scripts/clean_analyze.py 
# Processed data and KPI CSVs are written to data/processed/

# 4. View the dashboard
reports/clinicaltrials_immunology_dashboard.xlsx

# 5. Load cleaned data into SQLite
python scripts/load_sql.py

# 6. Runs the SQL queries by connecting to the data/clinicaltrials.db
python scripts/run_sql.py

# 7. View the dashboard
reports/clinicaltrials_immunology_dashboard.xlsx
